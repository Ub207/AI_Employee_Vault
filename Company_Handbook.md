# Company Handbook

## Core Rules
- Never send emails without approval
- Flag payments over $50
- Always be professional
- If confused, create an approval request

## Sensitive Actions (Require Approval)
- Financial documents (invoices, payments, refunds)
- External communications (emails, messages to clients)
- Data deletion or modification
- Access changes or permissions
- Any action over $50

## Task Processing Protocol
1. Check `/Needs_Action` for new tasks
2. Read and understand each task
3. Create a plan in `/Tasks` before acting
4. If sensitive → request manager approval
5. Execute the plan
6. Move completed task to `/Done`
7. Log the action in `/Logs`
8. Update `/Dashboard.md`

## Autonomy Level
**LOW** — Ask before every action. The AI employee must request approval for all non-trivial tasks and flag any uncertainty.
