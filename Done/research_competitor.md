## Key Takeaways

1. **Free tier is a differentiator** — Competitor B offers a free plan which drives user acquisition. Consider whether a freemium model fits our strategy.

2. **Pro pricing clusters around $49-60/user/mo** — This is the market standard. Pricing significantly above or below this range needs strong justification.

3. **Enterprise is always custom** — All competitors use "Contact Sales" for enterprise, indicating high-touch sales is industry standard at scale.

4. **API access is a premium feature** — Competitors gate API behind Pro or Enterprise plans. This is a clear monetization lever.

5. **Security/compliance sells Enterprise** — SOC2, SAML SSO, and governance features are the key drivers for enterprise upgrades.

## Recommendation
Position our pricing competitively within the $40-60/user range for Pro. Consider a limited free tier to drive acquisition. Gate API access and enterprise security features for upsell.
