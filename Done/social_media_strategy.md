## Day 6 — Saturday: BEHIND THE SCENES

### LinkedIn
**Caption:**
Building [Product Name] wasn't easy.

We started with one question: "What if AI could work like an employee — not just answer questions, but actually DO the work?"

That led us to build:
- A markdown-based task system
- A company handbook the AI actually follows
- An approval pipeline for sensitive actions
- Full audit logging

6 months later, here we are.

Thank you to everyone who believed in this vision.
