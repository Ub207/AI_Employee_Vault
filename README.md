**Drop a task. AI prioritizes it. Sensitive? It asks first. Then executes within SLA, logs, and reports.**

## What is a Digital FTE?

A **Digital Full-Time Equivalent** is an AI agent that operates like a real employee:

- Has a **workspace** (this Obsidian vault)
- Follows a **Company Handbook** with rules and autonomy levels
- Picks up tasks from an **inbox** (`/Needs_Action`)
- **Classifies priority** (P0-P3) and tracks **SLA deadlines**
- **Plans before acting** and **asks for approval** on sensitive items
- **Logs everything** it does for full auditability
- **Schedules recurring tasks** automatically via cron
- Moves completed work to `/Done`

> Think of it as an AI coworker with its own desk, rules, priority queue, and a manager to report to.

| Folder / File | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `/Needs_Action` | Inbox — drop tasks here for the AI to pick up |
| `/Tasks` | Active plans and work-in-progress |
| `/Pending_Approval` | Tasks awaiting manager sign-off (with reminders) |
| `/Approved` | Approved tasks (audit record) |
| `/Rejected` | Declined tasks with feedback |
| `/Done` | Completed tasks with SLA metadata |
| `/Logs` | Daily action logs — full audit trail |
| `config.yaml` | Central config — priority, SLA, sensitivity, scheduler |
| `config_loader.py` | Shared utility for reading config + logging |
| `sensitivity_scorer.py` | Weighted keyword scoring with context awareness |
| `scheduler.py` | Cron-based recurring task creation |

---

## How It Works

### Task Lifecycle

```
1. Drop a task into /Needs_Action (or scheduler creates one)
2. AI classifies priority (P0-P3) and stamps SLA deadline
3. AI scores sensitivity with weighted keywords
4. AI creates a plan in /Tasks
5. If sensitive → approval request in /Pending_Approval (reminders/escalation)
6. If routine → AI executes immediately
7. Completed task moves to /Done with full SLA metadata
8. Action logged in /Logs with priority info
9. Dashboard updated with SLA performance
```

### Priority System

| Priority | Label | SLA Window | Auto-Detect Keywords |
|----------|-------|------------|---------------------|
| **P0** | Critical | 1 hour | "urgent", "critical" |
| **P1** | High | 4 hours | "asap", "deadline" |
| **P2** | Medium | 24 hours | (default) |
| **P3** | Low | 72 hours | — |

### Sensitivity Detection

Smart weighted scoring replaces simple keyword matching:

| Keyword | Weight | Category |
|---------|--------|----------|
| password | 1.0 | access_change |
| payment | 0.9 | financial |
| delete | 0.9 | data_deletion |
| invoice | 0.8 | financial |
| email | 0.6 | external_communication |
| client | 0.5 | external_communication |

Context modifiers adjust scores: "email" + "client" = higher score, "email" + "internal" = lower score. Threshold configurable in `config.yaml` (default: 0.6).

### Autonomy Levels

| Level | Routine Tasks | Sensitive Tasks |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **LOW** | Ask for approval | Ask for approval |
| **MEDIUM** | Auto-execute | Ask for approval (current) |
| **HIGH** | Auto-execute | Auto-execute (log warning) |

---

## Demo Workflow

This vault ships with **8 completed tasks** showing both workflow paths:

### Task 1: Client Invoice (Sensitive Path)
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Detected | `test_task.md` — "Client asked for invoice" |
| Priority | P2 (default) — SLA: 24 hours |
| Sensitivity | Score: 0.8 — Category: financial |
| Result | Blocked → Approval requested → Approved → Completed |

### Task 2: Weekly Report (Routine Path)
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Detected | `weekly_report.md` — "Prepare weekly progress report" |
| Priority | P2 (default) — SLA: 24 hours |
| Sensitivity | Score: 0.0 — No signals |
| Result | Auto-processed → Completed within SLA |

### Task 3: Urgent Client Email (Priority + Sensitive)
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Detected | `client_email.md` — "Send follow-up email to client ASAP" |
| Priority | P1 (auto-detected: "ASAP") — SLA: 4 hours |
| Sensitivity | Score: 1.1 — Category: external_communication |
| Result | Blocked → Draft prepared → Approval requested → Completed |

### Final Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total tasks processed | 8 |
| Sensitive actions flagged | 3 |
| Approvals requested | 3 |
| Approvals granted | 2 |
| Completion rate | 100% |

| **Dashboard** | `Dashboard.md` — SLA performance, priority distribution, overdue tracking, queue stats |
| **Task Detection** | AI reads inbox, scores sensitivity, classifies priority, stamps SLA |
| **Approval Pipeline** | Sensitive tasks blocked with reminders and escalation tracking |
| **Audit Log** | Every action timestamped with priority and SLA info |
| **Completed Tasks** | Archived tasks with full SLA metadata |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (free)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai) (AI agent)
- Python 3.10+ with `pyyaml`, `croniter`, `watchdog`

### Setup

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ub207/AI_Employee_Vault.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pyyaml croniter watchdog
   ```

3. **Open in Obsidian**
   - Open Obsidian → "Open folder as vault" → select `AI_Employee_Vault`

4. **Configure (optional)**
   - Edit `config.yaml` to adjust autonomy level, SLA windows, sensitivity thresholds

5. **Drop a task**
   - Create a markdown file in `/Needs_Action` with your task description
   - Optional: add `priority: P0` in frontmatter for critical tasks

6. **Run the AI Employee**
   - Start the watcher: `python watcher.py`
   - Or run directly: tell Claude Code *"Process everything in /Needs_Action"*

7. **Watch it work**
   - Check `/Tasks` for plans
   - Check `/Pending_Approval` if sensitive
   - Check `/Done` when complete
   - Check `/Logs` for the audit trail
   - Check `Dashboard.md` for SLA stats
